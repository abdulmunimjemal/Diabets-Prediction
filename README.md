# Diabetes Prediction Model
This is a Diabetes Prediction model developed using the SVM (Support Vector Machine) Classification algorithm. The model utilizes the SciKit-Learn library for the model and, numpy and pandas for dataset manipulation.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various features such as age, BMI, glucose level, heart disease, hypertension, smoking history, etc. The SVM Classification algorithm is employed to classify the instances into diabetic or non-diabetic classes.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model was obtained from Kaggle. It consists of a collection of instances with features and corresponding labels indicating diabetic or non-diabetic status.

## Accuracy

The accuracy achieved by the Diabetes Prediction model is 96.4%. While this is a high accuracy rate, there is still room for further improvement. Potential areas for enhancing the model's performance could include feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, or exploring alternative classification algorithms.

## Usage

To use this Diabetes Prediction model, you will need to have Python and the required dependencies installed. You can then clone this repository and run the provided code files to train the model on your dataset or use it for prediction tasks.

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/abdulmunimjemal/Diabets-Prediction.git
cd "Diabets Prediction"
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
pip install scikit-learn
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install joblib
```

3. Read the comments in the notebook:
